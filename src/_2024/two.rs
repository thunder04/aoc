/// ## START
/// Read a character.
///     - It is a number. Store the digit to `s.lvl`. Advance input by one. Go to [START].
///     - It is a whitespace or newline.
///           - a) Do you have a `s.prev_lvl`?
///                - Yes. Calculate `s.lvl - s.prev_lvl`.
///                    - a) Is the result 0?
///                        - Yes. Go to [JUDGEMENT TIME].
///                        - No. Continue below.
///                    - b) Is the result within [-3, 3]?
///                        - Yes. Continue below.
///                        - No. Go to [JUDGEMENT TIME].
///                    - c) Do you have a `s.prev_signum`?
///                        - No. Store `sig(s.lvl)` to `s.prev_signum`. Go to [ALL GOOD].
///                        - Yes. Are `sig(s.lvl)` and `s.prev_signum` the same?
///                            - Yes. Go to [ALL GOOD].
///                            - No. Go to [JUDGEMENT TIME].
///                - No. Continue below.
///           - b) Was it a newline?
///                 - Yes. Increase `safe_reports` by one. Reset `s`. Advance input by one. Go to
///                   [START].
///                 - No. Go to [ALL GOOD].
///     - Is it something else? Stop. It is invalid input.
///
/// ## JUDGEMENT TIME
/// Which part are you solving?
///   - Part 1. Skip the entire line. Reset `s`. Go to [START].
///   - Part 2. Is `s.saw_unsafe_lvl` true?
///       - Yes. Skip the entire line. Reset `s`. Go to [START].
///       - No. Set `s.saw_unsafe_lvl` to true. Test the following scenario: Let prev =
///         `s.prev_prev_lvl` (it must exist at this stage), curr = `s.lvl`. Is it valid?
///         - Yes. The previous level is invalid. Set `s.prev_lvl` to `s.prev_prev_lvl` and `s.lvl`
///           to 0. Advance input by one. Go to [START].
///         - No. The current number is invalid. Set `s.lvl` to 0. Advance input by one. Go to
///           [START].
///
/// ## ALL GOOD
/// Set `s.prev_prev_lvl` to `s.prev_lvl`. Set `s.prev_lvl` to `s.lvl`. Set `s.lvl` to `0`.
/// Advance input by one. Go to [1].
